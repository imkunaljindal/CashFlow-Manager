A simple application written in JavaScript that helps to minimize the net number of transactions for the money spent among a group of friends. </br>
## Concept used:
This project is nothing but a real world application of Heap Data Structure. </br>
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:</br>

### Max-Heap: 
In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
### Min-Heap: 
In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
